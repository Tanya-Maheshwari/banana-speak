This is a minion Language Translator.   This is My First Vanila js web application. This is coded and designed using Hyper text markup language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), vanila java script. This is a web-app which translate your language into minion's language.
I have used VS code to code this web-app and also used Github desktop to make a repo and to push it on github.
